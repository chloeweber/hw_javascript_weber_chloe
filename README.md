##Comments

This assignment was very rewarding, but, admittedly, a bit difficult in parts (ESPECIALLY the inception function). I really appreciate your help with the inception problem, even if I still didn't get it right. To be honest, the bit of Javascript we learned in Advanced Web 1 was so rushed, I didn't retain much of it. I do think I am getting the hang of it though, and I'm excited to continue learning.
